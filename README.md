# A compatibilization plugin for MythicMob drops while using AdvancedSpawners.

Pre-requirements:
- AdvancedSpawners ( https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/1-8-1-17-%E2%9C%85-advancedspawners-%E2%9C%85-11x-custom-mobs-%E2%AD%95-create-custom-mobs-in-game-%E2%9A%A1-25-sale-%E2%9A%A1.75458/ )
- MythicMobs v4.11+ ( https://www.spigotmc.org/resources/%E2%9A%94-mythicmobs-free-version-%E2%96%BAthe-1-custom-mob-creator%E2%97%84.5702/ )
- Spigot/Paper +1.12

What this plugin *basically* does is to use MythicMobs API to force custom mob drops when a mob dies (It only forces them when they should be dropped, so chances are still working) and adds that kill to vanilla statistics (Which also doesn't happen when you kill a MythicMobs mob when using AdvancedSpawners).

If you're having any issue related to this plugin, feel free to create a new Issue.
We *probably* won't add more features, however, feel free to open a request if you think that we should add anything else. And if anyone else wants to maintain the plugin, also feel free to open a Pull request and we'll check it out!

**Thanks to [Segu](https://github.com/segu23) for developing this plugin.**
